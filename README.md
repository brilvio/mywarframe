# mywarframe
Page where you can track your progress (MR,Warframes,Weapons) on warframe

## Idea

The initial idea is to make an express server with typescript and the webpage with Vue.js where the player can log in and track his progress, like what Warframes he have and if he already mastered (lvl up to lvl 30) that warframe, also weapons and companions.

Track his blueprints for prime parts and show how for how much they are selling, make a "shop" list so you can see what relics you want to buy/farm for an specifc blueprint.

Track your relic opening farm so you can see what you got already, and make sugestions to what to pick.
